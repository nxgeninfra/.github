## Which Spec?

- [ ] GIS (GPU Instance Specification)
- [ ] JSON Schema (schema/v1.json)
- [ ] Other (describe)

## Issue Type

- [ ] Missing field — a real-world attribute can't be described
- [ ] Ambiguity — a field definition is unclear
- [ ] Edge case — a valid offering can't be represented
- [ ] Validation — schema rejects a valid document or accepts an invalid one
- [ ] Documentation — spec text needs clarification

## Description

<!-- Describe the problem clearly -->

## Real-World Example

<!-- Show a real provider offering that exposes this issue -->

```json
{
  // Example GIS document showing the problem
}
```

## Proposed Solution

<!-- How should the spec handle this? -->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!-- Would your proposed change break existing GIS documents? -->
- [ ] Yes (requires major version bump)
- [ ] No (additive/optional change)
